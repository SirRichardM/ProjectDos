Features

- Homepage - featuring images and stylized css. 
- "Classics" page - this will have photos/posters of classic horror movies, when clicked they will lead to information including synopsis, cast, stills that are applicable, posterrs. Critical reception. User input for whether they like it or not. A comments section for people to leave brief idea of how they feel. 
- at the bottom of "classics' page will be similar movies that are lesser known - i want to have three tiers of obscurity - classics, lesser knowns and the very obscure (maybe a fourh tier that has absolute garbage basically unknown).
- Second tier will have other similar movie link butts these will be the very obscure list.
- movies will have tags according to the "classic" they relate to. 
- when you click on the lower levels - when it brings you to a "main" page with information - bottom will be a list of other movies in the genre.
- will also have a horror anime section - will be small but want the site to be all things horror.
- Horrow shows as well.


###########

A search section that just has a link to movie database to search for horror. No links as this will be hard to decipher.

- To incoprorate video games into this I will also have a section for video games that correspond to the horror movies. Example being evil dead, friday the 13th, the thing, silent hill, resident evil (use isle of the dead, dead island for one somehow). If the user clicks on a classic that has a video game associated it will show up as well.

-Video games will have same features as horror movies

MVP : Functional click to get information on movies and components leading into new ones

##############

Stretch Goals -

Be able to have people become members and require it to leave comments so only qualifed horror buffs can join and it isnt flooded with noobs. 

Expand to classic horror comic books (and I guess new ones to be fair) as well as books. 

Have cross platform suggestions with similarties. Ideally would be nice to create my own tags for things.

Have an All section, although this is incredibly easy and  kind of  deters from the interactivity of discovering things through clicking.
